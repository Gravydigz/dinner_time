**Source:** The Modern Proper

## Ingredients
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
- 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1 tsp chicken bouillon (or 1 bouillon cube)
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (7 oz) jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, thinly sliced
- Cooked pasta or mashed potatoes for serving (optional)

## Instructions
1. **Brown the chicken:** Pat chicken dry and season with 1 tsp salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken undisturbed until golden, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate
2. **Make the sauce:** Reduce heat to medium. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant (30 seconds). Stir in cream, chicken stock, bouillon, 1/4 cup Parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt. Whisk until smooth
3. **Cook together:** Return chicken to skillet, nestling into sauce. Simmer over medium-low heat until internal temperature reaches 165°F (about 8-10 minutes)
4. **Serve:** Top with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan and fresh basil. Serve over pasta or potatoes
